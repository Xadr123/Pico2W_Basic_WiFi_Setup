# Pico 2 W Basic WiFi Setup
An example project for setting up a basic Wifi connection using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.

If you would like to use this example yourself, you will need to rename sample.config.h to config.h, and edit its contents accordingly.

Requires CMake to build and compile. Settings are also setup to use the Raspberry Pi Pico Project extension in VSCode to easy load the program onto your Pico.
